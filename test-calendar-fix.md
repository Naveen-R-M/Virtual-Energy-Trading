# Calendar Fix Verification

## Changes Made

### 1. Global Locale Configuration
- Added `ConfigProvider` with `enUS` locale at the App.tsx level
- This ensures all Arco Design components use English language by default

### 2. Date Restriction for Future Dates
- The DatePicker in Dashboard.tsx already has `disabledDate` function that prevents selecting future dates
- Code: `disabledDate={(current) => current && current.isAfter(dayjs().endOf('day'))}`
- This disables any date after today's end of day

### 3. Clean Code Structure
- Removed duplicate ConfigProvider instances from individual pages
- Centralized locale configuration at the app root level
- Added comments for clarity

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Calendar Language:**
   - Navigate to Dashboard page
   - Click on the date picker
   - Verify that:
     - Days of week show as: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun (not Chinese characters)
     - Month names show in English: January, February, etc.
     - Today button shows as "Today" not Chinese text

3. **Test Future Date Restriction:**
   - Try to select tomorrow's date or any future date
   - These dates should be grayed out and unclickable
   - Only today and past dates should be selectable

## Files Modified

1. **App.tsx**
   - Added ConfigProvider with enUS locale wrapping entire app
   - Imported enUS locale from Arco Design

2. **Dashboard.tsx**
   - Removed duplicate ConfigProvider
   - Removed redundant locale import
   - DatePicker already has future date restriction

3. **OrderManagement.tsx**
   - Removed unused enUS import for consistency

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Localization:** All Arco components now use English throughout the app
2. **Future-Proof:** New components will automatically inherit English locale
3. **Cleaner Code:** No duplicate locale configurations
4. **Logical Date Selection:** Users can only select valid trading dates (today or past)
